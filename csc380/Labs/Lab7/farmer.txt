// Wolf
// Goat
// Cabbage

// Statuses:: w(est), e(ast)

state(w,w,w,w)
// All on west bank

// Farmer takes goat to east

state(w,w,e,w)
// Farmer returns to west

state(e,e,e,w)
// Farmer takes wolf east

state(w,e,w,w)
// Farmer returns west with goat

state(e,e,w,e)
// Farmer returns east with cabbage

state(w,e,w,e)
// Farmer returns west alone

state(e,e,e,e)
// Farmer returns east with goat, completing journey

Essentially, backtracking is a way of taking steps back when a deadend or failed solution is found. This makes it easier to try every combination without completely restarting, and explores states in a localized/regional fashion

// II d)
Similar to the previous problem, there is a river that can only be crossed with one passenger at a time, and the passengers are different sets of couples. The women can only be left with men if their husband is present. This makes it so there can't be more women than men if there are both men and women on the same side.
