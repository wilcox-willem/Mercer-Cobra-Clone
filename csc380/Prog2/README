The general outline of my algorithm will be:

    For each location/cell do the following per turn/evolution

    1. Determine number of neighbors (check within bounds)
    2. If 0-1 neighbor(s), die (lonely)
    3. If 2-3 neighbors, age 1 (or birth)
    4. If 4+ neighbors, die (crowded)
    5. Finally, if 10 years old, die

    Do all of this on a copy of the board, then
    update the current board with the copy 
    (to keep evolution at the same time)

To run:

    Use the following command

    python3 GoL_ww.py
