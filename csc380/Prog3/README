////// This will be a broad summary of the changes and ideas I have implemented to the original Eliza concept //////

For starters, I personally added more dialogue to the dialogue.txt file and tried to add more questions
that would result in yes/no answers which then lead to user explanation, which then leads back to yes/no

This in effect adds and expands upon the "keep the user distracted and focused on themself" to make
the bot more convincing

Furthermore, I added a feature so that responses take a random amount of time (1 sec to 5 sec)
This makes responses from Eliza feel a little more variable and not always immediate. 
[NOTE: this can be annoying for testing, so it can be disabled by using ANY extra command arg]

Finally, I thought it would be nifty to add random facts to Eliza, because I'm known by family and friends
to just randomly tell them bizzare, random, or useless facts. Plus I tend to just uncontrollably sprinkle them in, so it almost feels perfect

I used a file someone previously made, and added more facts that I thought were cool.

////// This is a more in depth explanation of my algorithm for getting/editing responses //////

First, the dialogue.txt file is parsed, and it stores each group of responses to a key of
the different user inputs

// For example, the dialogue may look like: // 
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
once i | a couple times i       // these are the keys, seperated by "|",
Would you do it again?          // each line below the keys before the "#"
Did it end how you predicted?   // is considered a group of responses attatched to each key,
#                               // finally, this tells that the responses are over and the next key is starting
you are |you're |youre 
Why do you think I am *?        // any line with an "*" cuts the user_input by the key found,
Why do you say I am *?          // and inserts the latter portion of user_input inplace of the "*"
#
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .

// storage is dictionary style, so dialogue is stored similar to whats below

{[once i ],{[Would you do it again?],[Did it end how you predicted?]}}
{[couple times i ],{[Would you do it again?],[Did it end how you predicted?]}}
{[you are ],{[Why do you think I am *?],[Why do you say I am *?]}}
{[you're ],{[Why do you think I am *?],[Why do you say I am *?]}}
{[youre ],{[Why do you think I am *?],[Why do you say I am *?]}}

// Once it is all stored, it is sorted by key length longest to shortest. //
// This way, whenever searching it is more likely to identify any complex keys first //

// While Eliza is running, it will process and check user responses in the following manner:

[Note, once Eliza finds a response it prints, then jumps back to listening.
 This saves time by not having to do every step of the response check to print]

First, clean input by removing stop words, and making all input lower case

Second, check if user input directly matches any keys, if so randomly choose from key's response group, then print

Third, if user input contains any keys, pull random response and check for "*" response handling, then print

Finally, if no response found yet, pull response from '__NO_MATCH__' section of dialogue

////// Random Fact implementation //////

The random facts are stored in a Facts.txt file, where each line is a fact. To store them,
each line is appended to a list, where access will almost always be in a random fashion

Eliza has a "fact_timer" that starts 1-5 and each response loop, it lowers by 1.
Once it is lower than 1, Eliza interrupts the conversation to tell a random fact,
then the fact_timer is set back to 6-10.
